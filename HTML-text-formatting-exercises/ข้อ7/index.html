                When writing in HTML, the 
        tag is a block element used to designate
        preformatted text. It is useful 
        because the text between 
        tags has both its spaces and 
        line break preserved in addition 
        to being displayed in a fixed-width 
        font. The following sections contain 
        information about this tag, including
        an example of it in use, as well as
        related attributes and browser compatibility.
